## Methodology

### Data acquisition

Data from Wikidata will be acquired using the Wikidata Query Service [@https://query.wikidata.org/] and associated wrapper packages in Python, 
such as WikidataIntegrator[@https://pypi.org/project/wikidataintegrator/] and wikidata2df [@https://pypi.org/project/wikidata2df/].

Data from PanglaoDB will be acquired through their [web interface](https://panglaodb.se/index.html) and [metadata database dump repository](https://github.com/oscar-franzen/PanglaoDB).

All data used will be handled with commonly used Python data science packages, such as Pandas[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3630805], Seaborn[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3767070] and Jupyter[@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.53].

### Reconciliation

The metadata from PanglaoDB on cell types, genes, tissues (including germ layers) and organs will be matched to Wikidata items using the reconciler[@https://pypi.org/project/reconciler/] Python package, which is itself a wrapper around the well known OpenRefine[@https://openrefine.org/]
reconciliation service, as well as manual intersections of both data sources. 
Data from the reconciliation service will be considered a match if the service returns a value of "match" equals to "True". 

### Item quality assessment

Wikidata items will be assessed for their quality by their number of statements, which can be acquired via both the MediaWiki API [@https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API] and Wikidata's own query service. And also by the presence of external identifiers, such as Ensembl Gene[@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz966] and Entrez Gene[@doi:10.1093/nar/gks1189] IDs for genes, Cell Ontology[@pmid:27377652] IDs for cell types and Uberon[@pmid:22293552] IDs for organs and tissues.
