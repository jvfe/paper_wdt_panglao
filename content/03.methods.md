## Methodology

After obtaining approval from the database owners, we matched genes and cell types to Wikidata and performed Wikidata queries to demonstrate the value of the approach. 
An overview of the process is shown in @fig:iscb_intro.

### Data acquisition

Gene data from Wikidata was acquired using the Wikidata Query Service for *Homo sapiens* genes and *Mus musculus* genes, as well as their HGNC names.  

The markers dataset was downloaded manually from PanglaoDB's website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers/PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz>). It contains 15 columns and 8256 rows. Only the columns `species`, `official gene symbol`, and  `cell type` were used for the reconciliation. 

All data used was handled using the Pandas [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3630805] library.
### Class creation on Wikidata

Classes corresponding to species-neutral classes were curated from Wikidata using Wikidata's Graphic User Interface. 
A manually-curated dictionary matching terms in PanglaoDB to Wikidata identifiers was assembled and used for integration. 
Cell types that were not represented on Wikidata were added to the database via the graphical user interface (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem>) and logged in the reference table.

Species-specific cell types for human and mouse cell types were created for every entry in the reference table and connected to the species-neutral concept via a "[subclass of](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P279)" property (e.g. every single "[human neutrophil](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405102)" is a also "[neutrophil](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188417)"). 
Our approach was analogous to the one taken by the CELDA ontology to create species-specific cell types. [@wikidata:Q21284308]


Each item was labeled "human" + the label for the neutral cell type, described as "cell type found in Homo sapiens" and tagged with the statement "[found in taxon](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P703)" [_Homo sapiens_](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15978631). 
An analogous framework was used for mouse cell types, assuming that "mouse" in PanglaoDB meant [_Mus musculus_](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83310). 
Batch creations were added to Wikidata via the tool Quickstatements (<https://quickstatements.toolforge.org/#/>).

All genes in PanglaoDB either were already present on Wikidata. Gene names that resolved to multiple entities were excluded from the reconciliation. 

### Property creation on Wikidata

Properties on Wikidata need to be supported by the users in a public forum before creation. 
We proposed a property called `has marker` to the Wikidata community to represent the cell-type marker relation.  
We posted a message in the 17th of November presenting the property, domain, range constraints, and additional comments.

The following motivation statement accompanied the proposal: 

    "Even though the concept of a marker gene/protein is not clear cut, it is very important, and widely used in databases and scientific articles.

    This property will help us to represent that a gene/protein has been reported as a marker by a credible source, and should always contain a reference.

    Some markers are reported as proteins and some as genes. Some genes don't encode proteins, and some protein markers are actually protein complexes.

    The property would be inclusive to these slightly different markers.
    Some cell types are marked by absence of expression of genes/proteins/protein expression. As these seem to be less common than positive markers (no organized databases, for example) they are left outside the value range for this property"


The proposal contained specifications of the property such as:

- Description:
  - "a gene or a protein published as a marker of a species-specific cell type"
- Data type:
  - [Item](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Data_type#wikibase-item) (internal entities in Wikidata)
- Domain:
  - ?subject [instance of (P31)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P31) [cell type (Q189118)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189118)
- Allowed values:
  - {?object [instance of (P31)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P31)  [protein (Q8054)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8054) .}
  - UNION {?object [instance of (P31)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P31)  [gene (Q7187)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7187) .}
  - UNION {?object [instance of (P31)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P31)  [macromolecular complex (Q22325163)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22325163) .}
- Planned use:
  - Reconcile knowledge from the PanglaoDB marker database to Wikidata. In the future, expand to other trusted sources of cell type marker information.

### Integration to Wikidata 

The PanglaoDB markers dataset was downloaded manually from PanglaoDB's website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers/PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz>) for integration. It contains 15 columns and 8256 rows. Only the columns `species`, `official gene symbol`, and  `cell type` were used for the reconciliation. 
The reconciled dataset was uploaded to Wikidata via the WikidataIntegrator Python package [@https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator], a wrapper for the Wikidata Application Programming Interface. 
The integration details can be seen in the Jupyter notebooks at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/jvfe/wikidata_panglaodb).

## Access to reconciled data
### Wikidata dumps

Wikidata provides regular dumps in a variety of formats, including RDF dumps: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_download>. 
It is possible to also download partial dumps of the database with reduced size (ex: <https://wdumps.toolforge.org/dump/987> for all cell types with the `has_marker` property).   

### SPARQL queries

Besides the Wikidata Dumps, Wikidata provides an SPARQL endpoint with a Graphical User Interface (<https://query.wikidata.org/>). 
Updated data was immediately accessible via this endpoint, enabling integrative queries integrated with other database statements.

## Source code and data availability

<!-- this can be improved -->
All source code used for the study and data created during the study are available in a GitHub repository, 
<https://github.com/jvfe/wikidata_panglaodb>, as well as archived in a zenodo repository, <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4438614>.
