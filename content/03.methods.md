## Methodology

### Data acquisition

Gene data from Wikidata was acquired using the Wikidata Query Service [@https://query.wikidata.org/]
    - <https://w.wiki/bWc> for *Homo sapiens* genes and <https://w.wiki/bWe> for *Mus musculus* genes.

Data from PanglaoDB was acquired through their metadata database dump repository[@https://github.com/oscar-franzen/PanglaoDB].

All data used was handled using the Pandas[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3630805] library, 
with the Seaborn[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.4019146] and Matplotlib[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.4030140] libraries being used for plotting. 

### Reconciliation and matching

The metadata from PanglaoDB on cell types, tissues (including germ layers) and organs was matched to Wikidata items using the reconciler[@https://pypi.org/project/reconciler/] library, 
further matching was done using a custom stemming function on the item labels, via PorterStemmer from the NLTK library [@isbn:9780596516499]. 
Matches were considered perfect if the reconciliation service or the stemming function returned a value of "match" equals to "True". 
Matches were manually analysed for false matches, such as items with same labels but used for different concepts.

Gene data was matched manually using a Pandas [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3630805] inner merge, since both data sources contained identifiers, which should be the same.

### Item quality assessment

Wikidata items were assessed for their quality by their number of statements, 
which were acquired using a custom wrapper on the MediaWiki API [@https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API] and, 
in the case of gene data, via Wikidata's own query service, as stated in the Data acquisition section.

Furthermore, items were also assessed by the presence of external identifiers - all of which are Wikidata properties: 
Ensembl Gene[@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz966] ([P594](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P594)) 
and Entrez Gene[@doi:10.1093/nar/gks1189] ([P351](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P351)) IDs for genes, 
Cell Ontology[@pmid:27377652] ([P7963](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P7963)) IDs for cell types 
and Uberon[@pmid:22293552] ([P1554](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1554)) IDs for organs and tissues.
