## Cell Marker information on Wikidata

Adding marker information on Wikidata was not possible before this study and became possible after community approval of the property "has marker" (P8872) (see Methods).
Figure @fig:chat_marker shows 2 of the current markers of "human colinergic neuron"([Q101405051](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405051)), [CHAT](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14863671) and [ACHE](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q407983), as they seen on Wikidata.
The PanglaoDB is referenced both via URL to the website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers.html>) and a pointer to the PanglaoDB item on Wikidata, [Q99936939](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99936939).

Since Wikidata is an open system information about markers will be complemented by user contributions.
To date, no other project has systematically integrated cell type markers to Wikidata, and most information is provenient from PanglaoDB. The tables show the marker count for the 5 cell types of humans and mice with most markers on Wikidata, for both species around two hundred marker genes.

# Wikidata SPARQL queries enabled by the integration

Now that the PanglaoDB is released as Linked Open Data, we can make queries that were not possible before, including
federated queries with other biological databases, such as Uniprot [@https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql]
and Wikipathways [@https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:Semantic_Web].
Due to previous similar reconciliation projects, Wikidata already contains information about genes, including their relations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms,
something that led to the development of an R package, go2cell [@https://github.com/jvfe/go2cell],
that facilitates interconnection between cell types and GO terms via their markers.
<!--  -->

PanglaoDB's integration to the Wikidata ecosystem allows us to ask a variety of questions (figure @fig:chat_marker). The next section headers exemplify such questions.

Wikidata SPARQL queries bring to light hidden biomedical knowledge
](images/query_figures.png){#fig:queries}

### "Which human cell types are related to neurogenesis via their markers?"

As expected, the query below retrieved a series of neuron types, such as "[human purkinje neuron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404913)" and "[human cajal-retzius cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405091)." It did, however, also retrieved non-neural cell types such as the "[human loop of henle cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405109), a kidney cell type, and "[human osteoclast](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404928). These seemingly unrelated cell types markedly express genes that are involved in neurogenesis, but that does not mean that they are involved with this process. This reinforces the idea that one needs to be careful when using curated pathways to enrich one's analysis, as false positives abound.

The molecular process that gene products take part depends on the cell type. The SPARQL query below enables us to seamlessly compare  Gene Ontology processes with cell marker data, providing a fruitful sandbox for generation of hypothesis and exploration of the biomedical knowledge landscape.


| geneLabel   | cellTypeLabel                   |
|:------------|:--------------------------------|
| OMP         | human purkinje neuron           |

### "Which cell types express markers associated to Parkinson`s disease?"

Besides integration with Gene Ontology, Wikidata reconciliation makes it possible to complement the marker gene info on PanglaoDB with information about diseases. This integration is of biomedical interest, as there is a quest for detailing of mechanisms that link genetic associations and the diseases themselves.

"Disease genes" are often compiled from Genomic Wide Association Studies, which look for sequence variation in the DNA. These studies are commonly blind to the cell types related to the pathophysiology of the disease. In the query below, we can see cell types that are marked by genes genetically associated with Parkinson's disease. Even considering the false positives (as per the previously mentioned multifunctional nature of genes) this kind of overlook can aid domain experts to come up with novel hypotheses.

| geneLabel   | diseaseLabel        | cellTypeLabel    |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-----------------|
| BST1        | Parkinson's disease | human b cell     |
| BST1        | Parkinson's disease | human neutrophil |
| RIT2        | Parkinson's disease | human neuron     |
| SH3GL2      | Parkinson's disease | human alpha cell |
| SH3GL2      | Parkinson's disease | human beta cell  |

### Which diseases are associated with the markers of pancreatic beta cells?

We can check the cell-type to disease relation in both ways. Scientists that study specific cell types (and not necessarily specific diseases) might be interested in knowing which diseases are related to their cell type of interest. In the sample query below, I looked for the diseases linked to the [human pancreatic beta cells](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405087), which play an important role in controlling blood sugar levels. Reassuringly, top hits associated with markers included
[obesity](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12174) and [type-2 diabetes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3025883). Other diseases retrieved, such as [Huntington disease-like 2](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30990046) don't bear a clear link with sugar function, and might merit a further look by a domain expert to see if there are any hypothesis worth pursuing.

| diseaseLabel        | genes                   |   count | cellTypeLabel   |
|:--------------------|:------------------------|--------:|:----------------|
| obesity             | PCSK2, ADCYAP1, SLC30A8 |       3 | human beta cell |
| type 2 diabetes     | SLC30A8, TGFBR3         |       2 | human beta cell |
| Parkinson's disease | SH3GL2                  |       1 | human beta cell |
| asthma              | SLC30A8                 |       1 | human beta cell |
| aniridia            | PAX6                    |       1 | human beta cell |

## Improvement of Wikidata data on cell types

To reconcile a database to Wikidata, we need to match names on the databases, often in natural language, to the unique identifiers on Wikidata. We first employed an automatic approach based on Entities from PanglaoDB, that is, cell types, tissue types and organ types, were matched with Wikidata items, matching summary can be seen on Table @tbl:reconcilesummary.

Of note, Wikidata editors often mix first-order classes such as "cells" and "organs" with second-order classes like "cell types" and "organ types" (Supplementary Information). First-order classes point to real-world individuals, like the "Dolly sheep zygote" (a real-world "cell") and the "brain of Albert Einstein" (a real-world "organ"). Second-order classes point to classes, like "zygote" (a conceptual "cell type") and "brain" (a conceptual "organ type").

|         | PanglaoDB (count) |   Automatic matches (count)   |
|:--------|---------:|-------------------:|
| Cell types   |      215 |                 81 (37.67 %) |
| Tissue types |      246 |                 85 (34.55 %) |
| Organ types  |       29 |                 22 (75.86%) |
Table: Summary of the matched entities from PanglaoDB (August 2020).
{#tbl:reconcilesummary}


The difference between first-order classes and second-order classes is notoriously tricky, and biological databases and texts often practice unintentional punning  (the use of the same concept for different levels [@https://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/Punning]). For adding markers on Wikidata, we assumed that all information in PanglaoDB was about instances of cell types, and not specific cells.

After marker data from PanglaoDB was added to Wikidata, we tested the automatic classification method was able to detect most cell types matches for most cell types on PanglaoDB matches (Table
@tbl:finallook_summary). The improvement of 38% to 80% of automatically matched types is an evidence that our work improved cell type content on Wikidata, and will arguably facilitate the reconciliation of other cell-type related resources.

||  PanglaoDB (count) | Automatic matches (count)  |
|:-|--------------:|-------------------:|
| Cell types  |  215 | 173 (80.46 %) |
| Tissue types   |  246 |  63  (25.60 %) |
| Organ types    |   29 |  18 (62.06 %) |
Table: Summary of matched PanglaoDB entities after improvements were made (December 2020).
{#tbl:finallook_summary}

Noticeably, the proportion of automatic matches for other entity types (tissues and organs) seems reduced in relation to the first assessment (35% to 25% and 76 to 62%). These entities were not targeted by our work, but as Wikidata is a living resource, modifications in the database, such as reclassification of entities or adding of other similar concepts, may have reduced the performance of our simple reconciler.
