 # Cell types on Wikidata

As of August 2020, Wikidata had 264 items being categorized as a "cell type" (Wikidata ID Q189118), considerably less than in specialized cell catalogs, which count over two thousand cell types [@wikidata:Q28660708; @wikidata:Q36067763].
Strikingly, there were also 23 items categorized as "instances of cell (Q7868)" . This classification is imprecise, as an instance of cell would be an individual named cell from a single named individual.

Wikidata editors often mix first-order classes such as "cells" and "organs" with second-order classes like "cell types" and "organ types" (Supplementary Information). First-order classes point to real-world individuals, like the "Dolly sheep zygote" (a real-world "cell") and the "brain of Albert Einstein" (a real-world "organ"). Second-order classes point to classes, like "zygote" (a conceptual "cell type") and "brain" (a conceptual "organ type").

We diligently fixed and improved information on cell types on Wikidata. As of February 2021, the Wikidata database contained 1828 instances of "cell type" (see current status at <https://w.wiki/b2t>) and 0 instances of "cell" (<https://w.wiki/b2q>) highlighting the improvements in both quantity and quality.

## Cell Marker information on Wikidata

Adding marker information on Wikidata was not possible before this study and became possible after community approval of the property "has marker" (P8872) (see Methods).
Figure @fig:chat_marker shows 2 of the current markers of "human colinergic neuron"([Q101405051](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405051)), [CHAT](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14863671) and [ACHE](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q407983), as they seen on Wikidata.
The PanglaoDB is referenced both via URL to the website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers.html>) and a pointer to the PanglaoDB item on Wikidata, [Q99936939](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99936939).

Since Wikidata is an open system, information about markers will be complemented by user contributions.
To date, no other project has systematically integrated cell type markers to Wikidata, and, thus, most information shown here comes from PanglaoDB. The tables show the marker count for the five cell types of humans and mice with most markers on Wikidata, for both species around two hundred marker genes.

# Wikidata SPARQL queries enabled by the integration

Now that we re-formatted the markers on PanglaoDB as Linked Open Data, we can make queries that were not possible before, including
federated queries with other biological databases, such as Uniprot [@https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql]
and Wikipathways [@https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:Semantic_Web].
Due to previous similar reconciliation projects, Wikidata already contains information about genes, including their relations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

PanglaoDB's integration to the Wikidata ecosystem allows us to ask a variety of questions (figure @fig:chat_marker). The next section headers exemplify such questions.

Wikidata SPARQL queries bring to light hidden biomedical knowledge
](images/query_figures.png){#fig:queries}

### "Which human cell types are related to neurogenesis via their markers?"

As expected, the query below retrieved a series of neuron types, such as "[human purkinje neuron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404913)" and "[human cajal-retzius cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405091)." It also retrieved non-neural cell types such as the "[human loop of henle cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405109), a kidney cell type, and "[human osteoclast](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404928). These seemingly unrelated cell types markedly express genes involved in neurogenesis, but that does not mean that they are involved with this process. The seemingly confusing results reinforce the idea that one needs to be careful when using curated pathways to enrich one's analysis, as false positives abound.

The molecular process that gene products take part depends on the cell type. SPARQL allows us to seamlessly compare Gene Ontology processes with cell marker data, providing a sandbox to generate hypotheses and explore the biomedical knowledge landscape.

| geneLabel   | cellTypeLabel                   |
|:------------|:--------------------------------|
| OMP         | human purkinje neuron           |

### "Which cell types express markers associated with Parkinson's disease?"

Besides integration with Gene Ontology, Wikidata reconciliation makes it possible to complement the marker gene info on PanglaoDB with information about diseases. This integration is of biomedical interest, as there is a quest to detail mechanisms that link genetic associations and the diseases themselves.

"Disease genes" are often compiled from Genomic Wide Association Studies, which look for sequence variation in the DNA. These studies are commonly blind to the cell types related to the pathophysiology of the disease. In the query below, we can see cell types marked by genes genetically associated with Parkinson's disease. Even considering the false positives, the overview can aid domain experts in coming up with novel hypotheses.

| geneLabel   | diseaseLabel        | cellTypeLabel    |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-----------------|
| BST1        | Parkinson's disease | human b cell     |
| BST1        | Parkinson's disease | human neutrophil |
| RIT2        | Parkinson's disease | human neuron     |
| SH3GL2      | Parkinson's disease | human alpha cell |
| SH3GL2      | Parkinson's disease | human beta cell  |

### Which diseases are associated with the markers of pancreatic beta cells?

We can check the cell-type to disease relation in both ways. Scientists that study specific cell types (and not necessarily specific diseases) might be interested in knowing which diseases are related to their cell type of interest.  We looked for the diseases linked on Wikidata to the [human pancreatic beta cells](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405087), which play an important role in controlling blood sugar levels. Reassuringly, top hits associated with markers included
[obesity](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12174) and [type-2 diabetes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3025883). Other diseases retrieved, such as [aniridia](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q548719) - a disturb of the iris of the eye - do not bear a clear link with classic pancreatic functions and might provide novel insights on disease pathophysiology
