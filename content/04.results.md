## Wikidata reconciliation - initial look

Entities from PanglaoDB, that is, cell types, genes, tissue types and organs, were matched with Wikidata items, 
matching summary can be seen on Table @tbl:reconcilesummary.

## Analysis of item quality - initial look

Only *Homo sapiens* genes and Organs reconciled more than 50%.
In the case of genes, this is probably due to the Gene Wiki initiative [@doi:10.1093/database/baw015], 
a long-running project to improve biological information in Wikipedia and its sister-projects, including Wikidata. 

This is further illustrated by Figure @fig:gene_alt_ids, in which we can see that all *Mus musculus* gene items - 
and nearly all *Homo sapiens* items - 
analysed had the Entrez ID alternative identifier present - 
Most of the data from the Gene Wiki project came from NCBI, creator and maintainer of Entrez. 
Nevertheless, there are still many gene items without an "Ensembl Gene ID" property, 
showcasing the need for further work in migrating this important source of information.   
In the case of Organ data, there was a high number of matches both due to the fact that there were only a few number of items, but also
since most Organ entities have Wikipedia pages, that are, therefore, cross-linked using Wikidata, requiring the creation of these items. 

Regarding alternative identifiers, what was observed for genes cannot be said for histological entities, 
while there is significant progress in integrating UBERON IDs, there is near to no items with a Cell Ontology ID property (Figure @fig:histo_alt_ids).

A significant proportion of the matches we could acquire for histological data didn't contain in their data model an "instance of" (P31) property, 
this illustrates an extremely concerning fact: Although we could still match around 30 percent of the data - 
in the case of Cell types and Tissues - 
this data was probably "low-quality", that is, hard to find and even harder to obtain insights from, 
we can affirm this since the P31 property is the basis for most items in Wikidata, 
it's the most intuitive way to perform queries against their database and to annotate their items. 

Furthermore, there is a significant disparity between histological data and gene data: 
while we could only match around 37% of Cell types from PanglaoDB, and of those 55% didn't have P31, 
we matched 60% of *Homo sapiens* genes, and all of them had P31. 
This disparity is not clearly shown when looking exclusively at the number of statements for these items 
(Figures @fig:histo_boxplot and @fig:gene_violin), but it shows there is still a great amount of missing information
for biological data, in particular in regards to cell types.

## Wikidata reconciliation - final look

After the aforementioned improvements were made, 
data from PanglaoDB was reconciled once again, 
now most cell types had appropriate matches (Table
@tbl:finallook_summary).

||  # of total items |# of unique matches  |   % of total items that were matched |

| Cells     | 215 | 173 |80.4651 |

| Mouse Genes |  53793 |25124 |  46.705|

While it may seem that the information for other entity types may have decreased, such as tissues and organs, this is difficult to ascertain, as different items could have been merged for clarity or
were reclassified as belonging to different types not covered by this study. 

## Analysis of item quality - final look

As can be gathered from Figure @fig:finallook_reconciledbar, nearly all cell type items have the appropriate "instance of cell type" statement, with only 4 items still missing said statement and one item being classified as an "instance of gland". 

This is a considerable advance in improving the quality of cell type data in Wikidata, as having this simple statement will make these items easier to find and be expanded upon.
