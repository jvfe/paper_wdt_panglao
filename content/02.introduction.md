## Introduction

### PanglaoDB

PanglaoDB [@https://panglaodb.se/index.html] [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is a publically-available database that contains data and metadata on hundreds of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. 
It provides extensive information on cell types, genes, and tissues and manually and community curated cell type markers (Tables @tbl:panglao and @tbl:panglao2).
It also displays a rich web user interface for easy data acquisition, including database dumps for bulk downloads.

As of 8 December June 2021, the article describing PanglaoDB had been cited 230 times. 
Despite its use by the community, the database is on a 3-star category for Linked Open Data [@url:https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html] as it does not use the open semantic standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL) needed for a 4-star rank, neither the links to external data via standard identifiers that make datasets 5-star. 
Improving the data format is a valuable step in making biological knowledge FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). 
Thus, we provide a case study of making PandlaoDB available in a 5-star Linked Open Data Format on Wikidata.


The OBO Foundry provides a rich collection of linked biological identifiers [@url:http://www.obofoundry.org/]. 
However, reconciliation to OBO is challenging, as there are many ontologies, each with slightly different contribution guidelines. 
For that reason, we decided to reconcile PanglaoDB to Wikidata, which allows the simple creation of new terms, provided they follow Wikidata's notability criteria [@url:https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Notability]. 

### Wikidata

Wikidata [@https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page] is an open, freely editable, knowledge graph database within the semantic web [@https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/] that stores knowledge across a multitude of domains, such as arts, history, chemistry, and biology, using an item-property-value linked data model (Figure @fig:wdt-hep). 
It is easy to use and edit, by both humans and machines, with a rich web user interface and wrapper packages available in common programming languages such as R and Python. 
All the data within Wikidata is linked and inherently public domain.

Wikidata item example, showing item hepatocyte (Q827450), the labels change according to the user's language, but each item has a universal identifier, called QID.

Several advances towards biological data integration and biological data analysis in Wikidata have been made before, yielding positive results [@doi:10.1101/031971] [@wikidata:Q87830400] and showcasing its potential for bioinformatics-related analyses, such as drug repurposing and ID conversion [@doi:10.7554/eLife.52614]. 
Wikidata has been proposed as a unified base to gather and distribute biomedical knowledge, with more than 50 000 human gene items indexed and hundreds of biomedical-related properties [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103292].


As of August 2020, Wikidata had 264 items categorized as a "cell type", considerably less than the Cell Ontology, which counts over two thousand cell types [@wikidata:Q28660708; @wikidata:Q36067763].
Strikingly, there were also 23 items categorized as instances of "cell (Q7868)". 
This classification is imprecise, as an instance of cell would be an individual named cell from a single named individual, an example of conceptual disarray that often occurs on Wikidata. [@wikidata:Q109990743]


This study was motivated by the increasing importance of cell-type concepts in light of the Human Cell Atlas [@wikidata:Q46368626], and the need for improved interoperability of biological data. 
Thus, we aimed to provide a case study of making the core information of PandlaoDB available in a 5-star Linked Open Data Format while improving the modeling of the necessary concepts on Wikidata.
