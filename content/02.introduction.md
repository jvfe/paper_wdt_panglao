## Introduction

### PanglaoDB

PanglaoDB [@https://panglaodb.se/index.html] [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is a publically-available database that contains data and metadata on hundreds of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments, providing extensive information on cell types, genes and tissues, as well as manually and community curated cell type markers (Tables @tbl:panglao and @tbl:panglao2). It also provides a rich web user interface for easy data acquisition, including database dumps for bulk downloads.

As of 30 December 2020, the article describing PanglaoDB has been cited 88 times. Despite its use by the  the community, the database is on a 3-star category for Linked Open Data [@url:https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html] as it does not use the semantic open standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL) needed for a 4-star rank, neither the links to external data via common identifiers that makes datasets 5-star. Improving the data format toward W3C's gold standards is a valuable step in making biological knowlegde FAIR (Findable, Acessible, Interoperable and Reusable).


The OBO Foundry provides a rich collection of linked biological identifiers [@url:http://www.obofoundry.org/]. However, reconciliation to OBO is challenging, as there are many ontologies, each with slightly different contribution guidelines. For that reason, we decided to reconcile PanglaoDB to Wikidata, which allows simple creation of new terms, provided they follow Wikidata`s notability criteria [@url:https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Notability]. 

### Wikidata

Wikidata [@https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page] is an open, freely editable, knowledge graph database within the semantic web [@https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/] that stores knowledge across a multitude of domains,
such as arts, history, chemistry and biology, using an item-property-value linked data model (Figure @fig:wdt-hep). It is easy to use and edit, by both humans and machines, with a rich web user interface and wrapper packages available
in common programming languages such as R and Python. All the data within Wikidata is linked and inherently public domain, thus, it presents a great opportunity to make scientific data more FAIR (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), as well as provides the necessary tools to curate and develop ontologies.

Wikidata item example, showing item hepatocyte (Q827450), the labels change according to the user's language, but each item has a universal identifier, called QID.

Several advances towards biological data integration and biological data analysis in Wikidata have been made before, yielding positive
results [@doi:10.1101/031971] [@wikidata:Q87830400] and showcasing it's potential for bioinformatics-related analyses, such as drug repurposing and ID conversion [@doi:10.7554/eLife.52614]. Wikidata has been proposed as a unified base to gather and distribute biomedical knowledge, with more than 50 000 human gene items indexed and hundreds of biomedical-related properties [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103292].


 Wikidata is nevertheless a collaborative database, and content is available on different levels of quality. For example, as of August 2020, cell type information was still very lacking, with only 264 items being categorized as "instances of cell types (Q189118)" (<https://w.wiki/b2w>), while other projects describe over 2.000 cell types [@wikidata:Q28660708][@wikidata:Q36067763]. Of those, only nine have a "Cell Ontology ID"[@pmid:27377652] (P7963) associated, and most have a varying amount of statements (Table @tbl:cell-counts). As an additional problem, there are also 23 items being categorized as "instances of cell (Q7868)" (<https://w.wiki/b2x>), illustrating the absence of any formal data model.

| Cell type Item | Number of statements |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| red blood cell (Q37187) | 48 |
| myocyte (Q428914) | 18 |
| mesenchymal cell (Q66568500) | 2 |
Table: As of August 2020, Wikidata items regarding cell types have a varying amount of information, with most having very few statements.
{#tbl:cell-counts}


This study was motivated by the increasing importance of cell-type concepts in light of the Human Cell Atlas [@wikidata:Q46368626], and the utter need for improved inteoperability of biological data. We aimed, thus, at providing a case study of the  re-release PandlaoDB in a 5-star Linked Open Data Format while improving the modelling of the necessary concepts on Wikidata.
