## Introduction

### PanglaoDB

PanglaoDB [@https://panglaodb.se/index.html] [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is a public database that contains data and metadata on hundreds of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments, providing extensive information on cell types, genes and tissues, as well as manually and community curated cell type markers (Tables @tbl:panglao and @tbl:panglao2). It also provides a rich web user interface for easy data acquisition, including database dumps for bulk downloads.

Despite its usefulness for the community, the database is on a 3-star category for Linked Open Data [@url:https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html] as it does not use open standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL). To make it 5-star, it needs to be also linked to external data via common identifiers. 

The OBO Foundry provides a rich collection of linked biological identifiers [@url:http://www.obofoundry.org/]. However, reconciliation to OBO is challenging, as there are many ontologies, each with slightly different contribution guidelines. For that reason, we decided to reconcile PanglaoDB to Wikidata, which allows simple creation of new terms, provided they follow Wikidata`s notability criteria[@url:https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Notability]. 

### Wikidata

Wikidata [@https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page] is an open, freely editable, knowledge graph database within the semantic web [@https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/] that stores knowledge across a multitude of domains,
such as arts, history, chemistry and biology, using an item-property-value linked data model (Figure @fig:wdt-hep). It is easy to use and edit, by both humans and machines, with a rich web user interface and wrapper packages available
in common programming languages such as R and Python. All the data within Wikidata is linked and inherently public domain, thus, it presents a great opportunity to make scientific data more FAIR (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), as well as provides the necessary tools to curate and develop ontologies.

Wikidata item example, showing item hepatocyte (Q827450), the labels change according to the user's language, but each item has a universal identifier, called QID.

Several advances towards biological data integration and biological data analysis in Wikidata have been made before, yielding positive
results [@doi:10.1101/031971] [@wikidata:Q87830400] and showcasing it's potential for bioinformatics-related analyses, such as drug repurposing and ID conversion [@doi:10.7554/eLife.52614]. Wikidata has been proposed as a unified base to gather and distribute biomedical knowledge, with more than 50 000 human gene items indexed and hundreds of biomedical-related properties [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103292].


 Wikidata, however, is a work in progress, and might need extensive improvement. For example, as of August 2020, cell type information is still very scarse, with only 264 items being categorized as "instances of cell types (Q189118)" (<https://w.wiki/b2w>). Of those, only nine have a "Cell Ontology ID"[@pmid:27377652] (P7963) associated, and most have a varying amount of statements (Table @tbl:cell-counts). As an additional problem, there are also 23 items being categorized as "instances of cell (Q7868)" (<https://w.wiki/b2x>), illustrating the absence of any formal data model.

| Cell type Item | Number of statements |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| red blood cell (Q37187) | 48 |
| myocyte (Q428914) | 18 |
| mesenchymal cell (Q66568500) | 2 |
Table: As of August 2020, Wikidata items regarding cell types have a varying amount of information, with most having very few statements.

This work has the dual goal of re-releasing PandlaoDB in a 5-star Linked Open Data Format and improving the modelling of the necessary concepts on Wikidata.
