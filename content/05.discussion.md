In this work, we re-released the knowledge curated in PanglaoDB on Wikidata, connecting it to the semantic web. 
Each cell-type/marker statement was added to Wikidata with a pointer to PanglaoDB and a citation of the article, providing proper provenance. 
At the same time, we documented the process of database integration to Wikidata, providing a blueprint for future efforts. 

It is important to note that not all data on PanglaoDB was added to Wikidata. 
Fine-grained, database-specific details were too granular for a general-purpose database like Wikidata (e.g. the sensitivity and specificity attached to each marker-cell type pair). 
Eventhough, these data could be released in RDF format and be connected to independent SPARQL endpoints (as done in the Bio2RDF effort [@wikidata:Q56989268]), we focused on integration to Wikidata to take advantage of the built-in integration with various types of knowledge, as well as the tooling developed by the Wikidata community.  

As described in the methods session, we added species-specific terms to Wikidata for cell types of _Homo sapiens_ and _Mus musculus_ described in the PanglaoDB database. 
The use of species-specific cell-types is necessary because genes in Wikidata are also species-specific, connected to their taxon by the "[found in taxon](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P703)" properties.

/// Add discussions about multispecies / "species-neutral" genes and how biomedical science often uses those


/// Add notes about the social aspects: how easy is it to add new items? And properties? Is that easier than traditional OBO tools ? 

Linking biological with Wikidata allows out-of-the-box integrative SPARQL queries, as many biomedical ontologies and datasets have been already integrated to Wikidata, and are available in Wikidata's graph. 
Besides the well-known advantages of having data linked to the Linked Open Data cloud, the Wikidata integration provides user-friendly interfaces for the data. 
That includes both navigable html pages of classes and properties (e.g. <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q67801129>) as well as an SPARQL Query Service with user-friendly modifications to ease queries for beginners (<https://query.wikidata.org/>) with helper pages for learning SPARQL (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial>) or even requesting queries (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Request_a_query>).   


Wikidata also makes it easy for users to contribute. 
Wikidata allows editions directly in the Graphical User Interface, acessible for domain experts without programming or ontology training. 
In fact,  Wikidata may be the solution for an (at least) 7 year-old gap of an "community-based crowd-sourcing approach" for representing knowlegde about cell types. [@wikidata:Q34026802]
For those interest in continuous integration, the Python module Wikidata Integrator facilitates for python users to reconcile databases to Wikidata, and it has been used to build bots for several different biological databases [@wikidata:Q87830400].


/// Why Wikidata integration is different from Bio2RDF? What are the cons? Maybe mention Wikidata as an easy-to-use middleground that does not require _that_ much domain expertise about the complicated world of semantic technologies, formal description logic and even computer science in general. 


/// Wikipedia is a major source for biological knowledge. Data on Wikidata can be easily reused on Wikipedia and enhance the quality of articles about life-science subjects in semi-automated ways (as has been done before for drug-drug interactions)  [@wikidata:Q21503276]  .

This work exemplifies the power of releasing Linked Open Data via Wikidata, and provides the biomedical community with the first semantically accessible, 5-star LOD dataset of cell markers. It also paves the way for Wikidata reconciling of other databases for cell-type markers, such as CellMarker [@wikidata:Q56984510], labome [@doi:10.13070/mm.en.3.183], CellFinder [@wikidata:Q28660708] and SHOGoiN/CELLPEDIA [@https://stemcellinformatics.org/]). 
The approach can in essence be applied to any knowledge set of public interest, providing a low-cost and low-barrier platform for sharing biocurated knowledge in gold standard format. 
We hope that community will keep improving marker and overall biological content on Wikidata, and that the interlinked marker information will be useful for researchers all over the world.
