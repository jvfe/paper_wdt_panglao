## Abstract {.page_break_before}

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), a freely editable knowledge graph database, presents a great opportunity for the integration of biomedical knowledge, its well thought
linked data model can improve significantly the handling and distribution of scientific information. On the other hand, Wikidata is still lacking
in various aspects, in particular to what pertains to cell type information. This study aims to analyse how cell type knowledge is currently modelled 
in Wikidata and how it differs from other types of biological information, using, as a reference point, metadata from the well known single cell RNA sequencing database, [PanglaoDB](https://panglaodb.se/index.html).

**Keywords**: wikidata, knowledge graph, cell type, ontology.
