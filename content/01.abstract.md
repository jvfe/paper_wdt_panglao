## Abstract {.page_break_before}

[PanglaoDB](https://panglaodb.se/index.html) is a database of cell type markers widely used for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis. 
However, genes, tissues, organs, and cell types in the database are encoded by free text and lack identifiers. 
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), is a freely editable knowledge graph database useful for integrating biomedical knowledge. 
Its linked data model can massively improve the handling and distribution of scientific information. 

In this study, we explore the feasibility of enriching PanglaoDB with Wikidata identifiers. 
We accessed the state of reconciliation at the beginning of the project, comparing the modeling of genes, tissues, organs, and cell types on Wikidata. 
Taking advantage of the openness of Wikidata, we leveraged our initial analysis to contribute towards Wikidata completeness and enable full reconciliation. 
As a final product, we released the first SPARQL endpoint for cell marker information directly in Wikidata, in a 5-star open-linked data format. 
We hope that this study encourages further reconciliations of databases to Wikidata.
